      "reason": "The Pro debater presented a more comprehensive and well-structured argument, clearly articulating the risks of unchecked AI development and proposing regulation as a necessary solution for ethical and responsible progress. While the Con debater raised valid concerns about stifling innovation and the complexities of global regulation, their arguments were less compelling and lacked the same depth of reasoning as the Pro side."
