      "reason": "The Pro debater provided a more comprehensive and well-structured argument, effectively addressing potential risks and advocating for regulation as a safeguard for ethical development and public safety. While the Con debater raised valid concerns about stifling innovation, their reliance on self-regulation felt less robust than the Pro's call for established regulatory frameworks."
