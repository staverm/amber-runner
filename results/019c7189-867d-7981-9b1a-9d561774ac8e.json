      "reason": "The Pro debater presented a more comprehensive and well-structured argument, covering a wider range of essential aspects like safety, accountability, privacy, fairness, innovation, and international cooperation. The arguments were clear and directly addressed the topic. The Con debater raised valid concerns about the pace of innovation and potential disadvantages, but their arguments were less fleshed out and the proposed alternative of industry self-regulation felt less robust than the Pro's call for comprehensive regulation."
