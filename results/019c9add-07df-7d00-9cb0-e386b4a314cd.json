      "reason": "Both debaters presented clear, well-structured, and relevant arguments. The pro debater's arguments about safety, fairness, privacy, public trust, and international cooperation provided a more comprehensive and compelling case for regulation, addressing potential downsides by framing regulation as a facilitator of responsible innovation. The con debater's arguments, while valid, focused more on the potential negative impacts of regulation without fully addressing the proactive solutions offered by the pro side."
